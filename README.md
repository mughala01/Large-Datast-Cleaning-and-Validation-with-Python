# Air Quality Data Analysis

##Kaggle Project Overview

This project analyses and cleans the **Air Quality UCI dataset**, which contains hourly sensor measurements of various atmospheric pollutants and meteorological variables. The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical visualization** using Python, replicating workflows relevant to quantitative research and applied data science.

## Tools & Libraries

* **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* **Version Control**: GitHub

## Dataset Description

The dataset provides hourly records of air quality from sensors in an urban environment.

* **Pollutants**: CO(GT), C6H6(GT), NOx(GT), NO2(GT)
* **Sensor Signals**: PT08.S1(CO), PT08.S2(NMHC), PT08.S3(NOx), PT08.S4(NO2), PT08.S5(O3)
* **Meteorological Data**: Temperature (T), Relative Humidity (RH), Absolute Humidity (AH)
* **Time Stamps**: Date and Time

## Data Cleaning

* Removed redundant unnamed columns
* Converted text-based numeric columns to proper numeric types
* Replaced invalid sensor codes (`-200`) with missing values (`NaN`)
* Imputed missing values with median imputation
* Combined `Date` and `Time` into a unified `DateTime` index
* Verified and removed duplicate records

## Exploratory Data Analysis

* **Distribution analysis** of pollutant levels (CO, NO2, Benzene, etc.)
* **Correlation analysis** to examine relationships among pollutants and meteorological factors
* **Visualization of pollutant patterns** over time, identifying daily and seasonal structures

## Key Findings

* Pollutant variables exhibit skewed distributions, with significant outliers.
* Strong correlations were observed between pollutant levels and meteorological variables (e.g., temperature and humidity).
* Pollutants such as CO and NOx demonstrate clear diurnal patterns, consistent with traffic-related emissions.

## Future Work

* Extend analysis to time-series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM)
* Compare pollutant cycles across different seasons
* Build a dashboard for interactive visualisation

This way, your repo will read like a **mini research report**, not a casual Kaggle notebook. Recruiters skimming it will instantly see:

* You cleaned a messy dataset
* You applied **quant/stat skills**
* You can communicate results professionally

Do you want me to also draft a **short professional GitHub project description (2–3 lines)** you can paste into the repo header so it looks polished even before they click on the README?
